ğŸ”¹ numpy â€“ Used for numerical operations.
ğŸ”¹ matplotlib.pyplot â€“ Used for plotting graphs (decision boundary).
ğŸ”¹ sklearn.datasets â€“ Provides access to sample datasets (we use load_iris()).
ğŸ”¹ sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split â€“ Splits data into training and testing sets.
ğŸ”¹ sklearn.svm.SVC â€“ The Support Vector Classifier (SVC) for classification.
ğŸ”¹ sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score â€“ Evaluates model performance.

  ğŸ”¹ datasets.load_iris() â€“ Loads the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features each.
ğŸ”¹ X = iris.data[:, :2] â€“ We use only the first two features (sepal length and sepal width) for easy 2D visualization.
ğŸ”¹ y = iris.target â€“ The target labels:

0 â†’ Setosa
1 â†’ Versicolor
2 â†’ Virginica

  train_test_split() splits the dataset into:

80% for training (X_train, y_train)
20% for testing (X_test, y_test)
ğŸ”¹ random_state=42 ensures reproducibility (same split every time).

  SVC(kernel='linear') initializes an SVM classifier with a linear kernel (best for linearly separable data).
ğŸ”¹ svm_model.fit(X_train, y_train) trains the model using the training data.

Other Kernel Options:

'linear' â†’ Straight-line separation.
'rbf' â†’ Non-linear, curved separation using radial basis function.
'poly' â†’ Uses polynomial curves for separation.

  predict(X_test) â€“ The trained model makes predictions on the test dataset.

  ğŸ”¹ accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred) compares predicted labels (y_pred) with actual labels (y_test).
ğŸ”¹ Prints accuracy score (e.g., 83% = 0.83).

  
  ğŸ”¹ Creates a mesh grid covering the feature space for plotting decision boundaries.
ğŸ”¹ The step size (h = 0.02) determines grid resolution.


    ğŸ”¹ plt.contourf() draws the decision boundary.
ğŸ”¹ plt.scatter() plots the actual data points.
ğŸ”¹ plt.show() displays the graph.

Calls the function to visualize the SVM classification regions.

    Graph Output:

The decision boundary is drawn.
Different species are colored in different regions.
Data points (flowers) are marked in the scatter plot.
