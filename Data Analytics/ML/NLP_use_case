### **Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Explanation & Use Cases**  

#### **What is NLP?**  
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that helps computers understand, interpret, and generate human language. It combines **linguistics** and **machine learning** to enable computers to process text and speech in a meaningful way.  

#### **Key NLP Tasks:**  
1. **Text Processing & Tokenization** â€“ Breaking text into words or sentences.  
2. **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging** â€“ Identifying nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.  
3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** â€“ Detecting proper names like "Google," "New York," etc.  
4. **Sentiment Analysis** â€“ Determining whether text expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.  
5. **Machine Translation** â€“ Translating languages (e.g., Google Translate).  
6. **Speech Recognition** â€“ Converting spoken language into text (e.g., Siri, Alexa).  
7. **Text Summarization** â€“ Generating concise summaries of long documents.  
8. **Chatbots & Virtual Assistants** â€“ Enabling automated conversations.
